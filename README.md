# Odin Recipes

Hey everyone! This is my Odin Recipes project, which I built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The goal of this project was to get hands-on experience with basic HTML and create a simple recipe website.

## Project Overview

This project features a main homepage that links to individual recipe pages. Each recipe page includes details like ingredients, cooking instructions, and images of the dish.

## Technologies Used

- HTML (for structuring the content)
- Basic CSS (optional for styling improvements)

## What I Learned

Through this project, I was able to:

- Get comfortable with writing basic HTML structure.
- Learn how to create and link multiple web pages.
- Understand how to organize content effectively.
- Practice using lists, headings, and images in HTML.

This was a fun and educational project that helped me build confidence in HTML. I'm excited to keep learning and improving my web development skills. Hope you enjoy exploring the recipes!
